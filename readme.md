## Programming 1 - Introduction at Tampere University, Fall 2020
Hey, this repository contains some of my **spaghetti** code from this introductory python course I did on my first year, first semester of university. In all honesty, this repository should not be public for a million reasons, including the dire state of my code and also chance of someone doing that course to exploiting this dishonestly. **I sincerely request you to not to plagiarize the code if you are student of the course**. With that out of the way, please cut me some slack, I started this course after a year long sabbatical from my high school days of C/C++ programming. For most of the course, I mostly went after the points instead of writing readable code, but honestly you can see some improvement in later stage of the course. Anyway, the reason I am keeping this repo public is to show that I am familiar the basic of Python, but most importantly when I am helping a friend or a fellow student and I am not on my laptop, it's just so much easier to explain them my code rather than doing everything from scratch. I really enjoyed this course and applied for TA role which did not lead to any fruition to date, but I do find myself helping others with this course, so there's that. Anyway, thanks for the read! Idk why I wrote such a long readme xD
